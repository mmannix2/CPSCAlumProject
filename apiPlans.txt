The project is using a REST API.
HTTP verbs correspond with the SQL statements to edit data in our DB.
The create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations are:
C POST -> INSERT
R GET -> SELECT
U PUT -> UPDATE (We are not doing updates, instead delete the create)
D DELETE -> DELETE
Interactions with the database will be done by calling the API as follows:

<website> is the domain name of the site once it is up and running.

API calls for regular users:
    GET <website>/api/jobs
        View all data for all jobs in the DB.
    GET <website>/api/jobs/X
        I want to be able to search by using the api, but that has not been
        thought through yet.
    POST <website>/api/jobs
        Add a new job to the DB.
    
    GET <website>/api/volunteers
        View all data for all jobs in the DB.
    POST <website>/api/volunteers
        Add another volunteer to the DB.
    
    GET <website>/api/announcements
        View all data for all announcements in the DB.
